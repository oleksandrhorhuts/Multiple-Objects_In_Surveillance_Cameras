# Tracking_Multiple_Objects_In_Surveillance_Cameras
### Description
This is project for course EL2320 Applied Estimation. It is base on [Motion-Based Multiple Object Tracking](https://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/examples/motion-based-multiple-object-tracking.html). 
This project performs automatic detection and tracking of moving vehicles in a video from a surveillance camera. Generally, the program contains 2 parts: 1)Detecting moving objects in each frame , 2) Associating the detections corresponding to the same object over time. The motion of each track is estimated by a particle filter.
